A research-oriented developer with an eye on deeply technical elements of **zero-knowledge**, **S(N/T)ARKs**, **distributed consensus** and other **blockchain** technologies. I found myself in this field when thinking about "what if DB replicas are adverserial?". 

I have built interesting things you may want to look at, some of them being:

1. 🔐 In-code implementation of many zero-knowledge elements: see [CryptographyResearch](https://github.com/supragya/CryptographyResearch) 
2. ⛓️ **EVM indexer for historical pricing** with full high availability support, see [EtherScope](https://github.com/supragya/EtherScope) 
3. 🔌 A peer-to-peer packet sniffer for Tendermint (now CometBFT), see [TendermintConnector](https://github.com/supragya/TendermintConnector) 

These days, I've been coding, mostly in 🦀 Rust, and practicing some abstract linear algebra ✎ᝰ. on the side.
