Blockchain protocol dev with interest in **ZK** & **Distributed Consensus**.

Browse a few interesting things:

- A toy zero-knowledge virtual machine (proves computation without revealing it) from scratch: see [PixieZKVM](https://github.com/supragya/PixieZKVM).
- Some zero-knowledge / cryptography primitives and circuits: see [CryptographyResearch](https://github.com/supragya/CryptographyResearch) 
- Ethereum index with HA, DEX pricing, powering _www.blockpour.com_ for 10+ chains, see [EtherScope](https://github.com/supragya/EtherScope) 
- Fake P2P packet sniffing cometBFT client, useful for P2P applications: see [TendermintConnector](https://github.com/supragya/TendermintConnector)
