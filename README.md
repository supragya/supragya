A research-oriented developer with an eye on deeply technical elements of **zero-knowledge**, **S(N/T)ARKs**, **distributed consensus** and other **blockchain** technologies. I found myself in this field when thinking about "what if DB replicas are adverserial?". 

I have built interesting things you may want to look at, some of them being:

1. Zero-knowledge overlay for cometBFT (earlier tendermint) to make consensus zk-SNARKs friendly. Checkout **SnarkMint**.
2. In-code implementation of many zero-knowledge elements: Checkout the "research" repo
3. **EVM indexer for detecting MEV** with full high availability support
4. Tendermint P2P sniffer.
